Castor is a WordPress boilerplate parent theme for [Dioscuri](https://github.com/pryley/dioscuri).

Minimum theme requirements:

* PHP 7.1
* WordPress 5.2

## Installation

This theme is meant to be initialised by [Dioscuri](https://github.com/pryley/dioscuri).

However, Castor can also be initialised on its own by running the following commands (make sure you first have `composer` and `npm` installed, on macOS this can be done using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):

```
git clone https://github.com/pryley/castor.git castor
rm -rf castor/.git
composer install -d castor
```
